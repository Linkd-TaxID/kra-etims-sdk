# KRA eTIMS SDK (Python)

A high-performance "Public Handshake" SDK for integrating with the **TIaaS (Tax Identity as a Service)** Middleware. This tool facilitates compliant communication with `taxid-production.up.railway.app` for enterprises operating within the Republic of Kenya.

---

## Legal Foundation & Obligation

This SDK is engineered to facilitate compliance with **Section 16(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 470)**, as amended by the Finance Act (2023/2025). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Statutory Notice**: Effective January 1, 2026, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) will disallow any business expense deduction that is not supported by a valid eTIMS invoice transmitted via a compliant VSCU/OSCU architecture and linked to a verified Buyer PIN. 

By utilizing this SDK, organizations ensure their digital sales pipeline meets the rigorous standards of the **eTIMS Technical Specification v2.0**.

---

## The 'Middleware Moat'

While this SDK provides the interface logic (the "Remote Control"), it requires the **TIaaS Middleware** to function. The middleware manages the underlying, stateful KRA infrastructure:
- **VSCU Orchestration**: Management of the KRA-issued JAR files and Port 8088 services.
- **Security**: AES-256 `cmcKey` encryption and digital signature generation.
- **Resilience**: A 24-hour offline signing window, ensuring business continuity during transit-layer disruptions.

---

## Institutional Resilience

The SDK implements a strict mapping of HTTP 503 errors to the `KRAConnectivityTimeoutError` exception.

- **VSCU Offline Ceiling**: This error is triggered only when the 24-hour Virtual Sales Control Unit offline window is breached. 
- **Warm Cache Logic**: Validation of TCC and PIN metadata is served via local middleware caches to maintain sub-500ms latency for B2B checkout flows.

---

## Core Features

- **GavaConnect Sanitization**: Mandatory `@sanitize_kra_url` middleware strips trailing whitespace from URL strings to prevent signature failures on KRA production endpoints.
- **Proactive Token Refresh**: Implements a 60-second proactive OAuth 2.0 buffer, refreshing credentials preemptively to ensure zero-latency for high-volume high-concurrency environments.
- **Spec-Strict Models**: Full Pydantic V2 implementation of all 8 KRA functional categories (Initialization, Sync, Sale, Stock, etc.).

## Quick Start (Category 6: Sale)

```python
from kra_etims.client import KRAeTIMSClient
from kra_etims.models import SaleInvoice, ItemDetail, ReceiptLabel

# 1. Initialize Authority Client (Defaults to Railway Production)
client = KRAeTIMSClient(client_id="TIaaS_ID", client_secret="TIaaS_SEC")

# 2. Transmit Compliant Sale
try:
    sale = SaleInvoice(
        tin="P0000...", bhfId="00", invcNo="INV-001",
        custNm="Enterprise Client Ltd", rcptLbel=ReceiptLabel.NORMAL,
        confirmDt="20260221100000", totItemCnt=1, 
        totTaxblAmt=1000.0, totTaxAmt=160.0, totAmt=1160.0,
        itemList=[ItemDetail(...)]
    )
    result = client.submit_sale(sale)
    print(f"KRA Signature: {result['invoiceSignature']}")
except KRAConnectivityTimeoutError:
    # Handle VSCU offline ceiling breach
    pass
```

## Sovereignty & Data Protection

This SDK and the associated TIaaS Middleware are compliant with the **Kenya Data Protection Act (2019)**. All taxpayer metadata is handled in accordance with sovereign data residency requirements and encryption standards.
